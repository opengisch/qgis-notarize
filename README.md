#Â Notarized QGIS builds for macOS

This repository creates notarized builds of QGIS for macOS.
It is based on the pull request https://github.com/qgis/QGIS/pull/60039 and creates notarized builds of preview packages built there.
As such, they are currently experimental and meant for testing only.

Packages are signed with OPENGIS.ch certificats.

This is a public preview and will be moved to the https://github.org/qgis organization and run with OSGEO certificates before being published as stable release with QGIS 4.0 in October 2026.
